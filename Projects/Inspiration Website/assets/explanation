const explain = ["Life is not meant to be easy nor is it meant to be hard. We can never predict the outcome of what will happen next, but what we can do is embrace and adapt to it.",
                "You may hear this a lot in sports, but it holds more meaning than you think. The content we view everyday on social media, the foods we eat, even our simplest activities like standing are all things that our subconsious consumes and reflects back at us on the outside. The next time you do something, remember what you are teaching you subconsious so that way the habits you build are ones you can be proud of.",
                "You are going to fail, make decisions no one likes, accept, or respect. Yet through all that adversity, you made the consious decision to learn what you do affects everyone. These decisions can be passed down from generation to generation, and help build the future of what it needs to be.",
                "The only way to truly learn is by doing, not by contemplation. If you have a dream, find out what it takes to get there and commit to it.",
                "Do not limit yourself to one skill and boast about it as your biggest accomplishment. Learn as many skills as you can and boast about what you are doing because the real value to boast about is the process and struggles of how you achieved a powerful weapon",
                "This should be self explanatory, but there is always going to be someone out there who is chasing the same goal, dream, or achievenment you are wanting. So the question is, what are you doing different that they are not doing to get there first?",
                "Great things always happen on the inside. Find that drive within you and let it guide you to what you want."
