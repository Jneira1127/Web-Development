This repo is supposed to be a professional development resource to help build my foundation on web development. There are going to be four repos, each with its own sub-repos.

CSS repo will focus strictly on css content and challenges.
HTML repo will focus strictly on HTML content and challenges.
Javascript repo will focus strictly on Javascript and Typescript content and challenges.
projects repo will focus strictly on a collaboration of all three previous repos to achieve on personal projects.
